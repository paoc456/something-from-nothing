        <h3 class="artistname">WANG GAI</h3>
        Wang Gai (1677–1705), a scholar-amateur artist, was a native of Xiushui, Zhejiang province, but lived in
        Nanjing
        for most of his life. He became well known as the author of Jieziyuan huajuan (Mustard Seed Garden Manual of
        Painting), the most influential of all Chinese instructional manuals on painting. Wang Gai’s album of twelve
        leaves included in Three Perfections expresses his experience of the seasonal changes in the Jiangnan (South
        of
        the Yangtze River) region. In Listening to the rain, on the first page of the album, a poem is inscribed by
        the
        artist, in the regular style of calligraphy.

    <section class="huangshen">
        <h3 class="artistname">HUANG SHEN</h3>
        Huang Shen (1687–1768), one of the eight eccentric masters of Yangzhou, was known to excel in the three
        perfections of the scholar-artist, well demonstrated in his album of ten leaves of flower and bird
        paintings.

        The poem is written in a highly individualistic style of cursive calligraphy. Simplified and abbreviated,
        the
        Chinese characters appear broken up, united by a scattering rhythm. Shitao (Daoji) (1642–1707), a Chinese
        Zen
        (Chan) Buddhist monk and painter, comments in the Huayu lu (A Round of Discussions on Painting): ‘Painting
        is
        the idea [yi] within poetry. Is it not poetry the Chan (Zen) in painting?’ Shitao compares poetry to Zen in
        painting. The wisdom of Zen Buddhism is transmitted from mind to mind without relying on words.

    <section class="kimhoatam">
        <h3 class="artistname">KIM HOA TAM</h3>
        Kim was born in Saigon, Vietnam, in 1959. His family came originally from Fujian province in China. He
        migrated
        to Australia in 1984 and now lives in Melbourne. For more than twenty years the artist has immersed himself
        in
        the Zen or Meditative sect of Buddhism, which began in China in the sixth century. The Way, a spiritual
        path is
        a highly original and creative work that evokes a spiritual and aesthetic experience. With a mastery of
        calligraphy and ink, the artist has created a work that appears unassumingly simple in execution but is
        imbued
        with profound spiritual meanings. Underlying an apparent simplicity, it reveals layers of meaning and
        perception.

        In the middle of the calligraphy is a red seal, irregular in shape – like a leaf – that says suiyuan,
        meaning
        follow the interconnections or cause and effects in one’s destiny. The two most important characters of
        ‘man’
        (ren) and ‘Way’ (Dao) are accentuated in darker ink to show their importance to the meaning of the poem.
